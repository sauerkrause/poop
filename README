Turing tarpit language currently writing for PLT Games competition

^      	      	  increments accumulator
-      		  negates accumulator
`some-text' 	  places value of "some-text" local register in accumulator
`some-text+ 	  adds value of "some-text" local register to accumulator
;some-text' 	  places value of "some-text" global register to accumulator
;some-text+ 	  adds value of "some-text" global register to accumulator
>`some-text' 	  stuffs the accumulator into local register "some-text"
>;some-text' 	  stuffs the accumulator into global register "some-text"
>1 		  stuffs the accumulator onto stdout as an ASCII character
>2 		  stuffs the accumulator onto stderr as an ASCII character
0		  reads a character from stdin and places in accumulator
*some-text| 	  places current continuation in continuation variable 
		  "some-text"
?some-text| 	  replaces current continuation with continuation variable 
		  "some-text" if the accumulator is non-zero
{ 		  creates a new scope
} 		  exits the current scope, if any.

local registers are dynamically scoped.
